_Press_ is an Android library written in Kotlin that plays around with _Android Typography_ and _Android's FontMetrics_.

## Contents
A single view, called `PressTextView`, which extends directly from `View`, that mimics the behavior of a Printing Press.

## Purpose
- Examine and understand how text is rendered by showing (and customise) font **guidelines** (_ascent_, _descent_, etc): a sort of _debug mode_ for Typography!
- Beautify your content views with newspaper-like headers decorations: _middle-line_, _underline_, _highlight_, _shadow_, etc.

## Usage
### Dependency
Just add this dependency to your `build.gradle` file:
```
dependencies {
  implementation 'com.davethebrave.press:x.y.z'
}
```
### Implementation
TBD
